# Football Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Data Visualization course at École Polytechnique by Mathieu Antonopoulos and Enzo Pinchon. It provides an interactive platform to explore football statistics and trends from the top five European leagues over three seasons: 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024.

By focusing on user-friendly design and engaging visualizations, the platform differentiates itself from existing tools, offering a comprehensive yet accessible view of football data.


## How to Run the Project

1. Start a web server at the project root directory. For example, using Python:
```bash
    python -m http.server
```

2. Open the platform in your web browser:
```
http://localhost:8000
